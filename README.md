# Perfect Sandwich üçî

Cheesy and beefy, the perfect sandwich is possible to make with this easy to follow recipe. The recipe is from [UNIVSTUDENT](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/72657/best-hamburger-ever/) and I wanted to create a design for it that felt elegant and minimal. Because burgers are serious business.
